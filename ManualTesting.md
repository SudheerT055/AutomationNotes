Software Testing:-
-----------------

It is a process of executing an application with an intension of finding defects.

Testing:-
------

It is a comparison between expected and actual value is called as "Testing".

Software:-
---------
A set of executable programs in as computer is called as "Software".

Defect:-
------

While conducting testing on application if any expected value is not equal to actual value which is "Defect".

Failure:-
--------

If customer is not satisfied with the application then that is called as "Failure".

Error:-
-----
During development while writing code,if programmer finding any mistake from the application then that is called as "Error".


Project:-
-------

Which is developed by particular customer requirement called  as "Project"

Product:-
--------
Which is developed for multiple customer then it called as "Product".

Software Testing is divided into 2 types

1.Manual Testing
2.Automation Testing

1.Manual Testing:-
-------------------

Testing of an application with Human interactions is known as "Manual Testing".

Advantages:-
-----------
it is cheaper
we can test any types of testings.
we can test UI activities and minor changes.

Automation Testing:-
------------------
It is a process,to conduct an application with the help of tools and software is known as "Automation Testing".

				(or)

Converting Manual Test cases into automation scripts is also as "Automation testing".

SDLC and STLC:-
--------------
SDLC (Software development Life Cycle)
----------------------------------------
It will explain implementation activities of total development process.
1.Requirement Gathering
2.Analysis
3.Design
4.Coding
5.Testing
6.Implementation.
7.Support and Maintence.


1.Requirement Gathering:-
------------------------

At this stage C.E.O will goes to the client place finalizing the project and making the agreement between software company and corresponding client.
-->Once project has been finalized C.E.O will conduct one meeting that is called as "Kick-Off- Meeting".
-->In this phase Business Analyst will the requirements from the customer prepare to B.R.S and S.R.S
B.R.S(Business Requirement Specification) -->B.R.S will be prpared by Business Analyst 
S.R.S (SysteM Requirement Specification) -->S.R.S will be prepared by System Analyst.

2.Analysis:-
---------
Once requirements documents are prepared to current project requiremnets every software enginner concentrating on Various documents like B.R.S and S.R.S

3.Design:-
----------

Design documents is having 2 types
1.HLD (High level design) 
2.LLD (Low level design)
HLD can define outlook of an application
LLD can define inner look of an application

4.Coding:-
-----------
Based on customer requirements,programmer will develop the code for responsible module.

5.Testing:-
----------
Once coding is completed to confirm the correctness of the code which is conducted by the programmer is known as "White Box testing".
1.White Box testing
2.Black box testing
3.Grey box Testing.

6.Implementation:-
----------------
Once coding and testing has been completed successfully then the technical expert will develop the build into production server.

7.Support and Maintaience:-
---------------------------
If customer is facing any problem from the application then we have to provide to support and maintaience to the customer.

S.D.L.C Models:-
--------------------
S.D.L.C model is divided into 2 types.
1.Sequential model -->It is divided into 2 types 1.Waterfall and 2.V-Model
2.Incremental Model -->It is divided into 5 Types 1.Rad Model 2.Prototype 3.Spiral 4.Iterative 5.Agile Model

1.Waterfall Model:-
---------------------
1.Waterfall model is same as S.D.L.C process.
2.Whenever requiremnts is very clearand if it a small-size project.Waterfall model all implementation activites will be carried by step-by-step process
3.In validation is enough is enough verificationis not required.

Verification:-
----------
It is a process of verifying we are developing the project is right (or) not.

Validation:-
-------------
It is a process of validating we are developed the project is right (or) not.

Advantages:-
--------------
1.It is suitable for small size applications
2.Easy to understand
3.easy to manage

Disadavantages:-
------------
1.It is not big size applications
2.Once an application in the development (or)testing phase, it is very difficuit to go back and change the requirements.


2.V-Model:-
-----------
1.It is also Known as "Verification and Validation"
2.This model is suitable for small size application where the requirements are not clear and making mistakes while an application to reduce this stage software testing is applied
3.In V-model based on requirements development team and testing team will the start the work parallely.
4.In this model test engineer no need wait for 100% coding.


Adavantages:-
-------------
1.It is suitable for small size applications
2.Simple and Easy to Use
3.It saves the lot of time

Disadavantages:-
------------
1.It is not big size applications
2.In the middle of the project if we change any requirements both developments and testing documents need to be updated.


3.RAD Model:-
------------
RAD Stands for Rapid application development model.
2.Due to lack of time (or)within a short period of to complete implementation activites,we can go for RAD Model.
3.In this model module by module will be developed upto end of the project.
4.It is known  as "Mini project".
5.To develop mini project seperate will be scheduled and they will the activites and parallely will combine module-by-module.

Adavantages:-
----------
It is suitable for big size application.
2.TIme Saving

Disadvantages:-
------------
1.It is not suitable for small size application.
2.It is very expensive model because huge resourcesis required.

4.Prototype Model:-
-----------------------
1.Due to lack of requirements,to develop the application we can go for prototype model.
2.Instead of developing actual application we will design a dummy application.
3.Once its accepted by customer then based on the requirements all implementation activites carried out one-by-one.
4.If customer is not satisfied,again we have to change the requirements upto customer accepted.

Adavantages:-
----------
It is suitable for big size application.
2.If customer is confusing in the requirements based on sample we can continue implementation.

Disadvantages:-
------------
1.It is not suitable for small size application.
2.It is a time taking process

5.Spiral Model:-
--------------
Spiral model is best suitable for big size application.
2.If customer requirements are frequently changing then requirement by requirement will be added upto to end of the project
3.It is best long term term project.

Advantages:-
---------
It is suitable for big size application.
2.We can add extra requirements in the next phase.

Disadvantages:-
----------------
It is not suitable for small size applications
2.Time taking process
3.Expensive.

6.Iterative Model:-
-----------------------
1.It is also known as "Incremental model".
2.This model is suitable for big applications
3.In Iterative model,every project will be divided into all modules then module by module will be implemented.

Adavantages:-
-------------
1.It is suitable for big size applications.
2.Simple and Easy to Use
3.It saves the lot of time

Disadavantages:-
------------
1.It is not small size applications
2.In the middle of the project if we change any requirements both developments and testing documents need to be updated.

Agile Model:-
---------------
1.It is incremental model and it is big size applications.
2.It is Advanced SDLC Model this model activities look like small like waterfall model
3.In this model both Developers and testers work along with client respresentive people.
4.In this model module by module will be developed end project.
5.In this model we are going to Use "Scrum" Model
Scrum model has different activities

1.Scrum Master:-
--------------
The scrum master is who is going to lead the project.
-->The Project Manager (or)client will act as a "Scrum master".
--->The scrum master is reponsible for Scrum meetings and Sprint meetings.

2.User Stories:-
---------------
What ever the client requirement we are capturing from client is called as an "user stories".

3.Sprint plan:-
---------------
1.Sprint plan is a fixed time to complete current task
2.It will be decided by Scrum master.
3.During sprint plan,the user stories which we are going to collect and analayze and develop and test the delivery to the customer

4.Sprint meeting:-
---------------
Once sprint is completed ,then sprint will be decided under sprint meeting
-->In this meeting they will confirm the current sprint is delivered successfully (or)not  is any changelleges etc

My sprint 14 days/2 weeks
Client is having 100 requirements -->12 requirements

5.Scrum meetings:-
--------------------
On daily basis all team members will participate a quick meeting where will explain what are the activities perfomed yesterday and today.

6.Backlogs:-
-----------
During sprint plan,if they are not able to complete any user stories those will be taken as "Backlog".
-->For this backlog sprint time wont be extended.
--->these backlogs will be carried next sprint.

Advantages:-
-----------
1.Each and every sprint will be tested multiple times.
2.The requirement should be accepted at any stage.
3.We can maintain clear user stories.
4.By using scrum meetings directly we can interact with customers.
5.we can get clarifications very quickly.
6.Each and sprint will be delivered to customer directly.
7.100 % customer satisfication.

disadvantages:-
-------------
1.Maintaining sprint related information is very changelling task.
2.But we can overcome with some tracking tools.



white box Testing:-
--------------------
After completion of coding to confirm correctness of code which will be tested by developers.
In white box it is divided into 2 types
1.Unit Level 
1.Integration testing


1.Unit Level Testing:-
--------------------
A smallest testing part(or)portion in the same code of the application is called as "Unit testing".
--->Each and every part of unit testing working(or)not
-->Unit Testing is also known as "Module Testing".

2.Integration Testing:-
-----------------------

Once Unit testing is completed developer will checks interactions among all units is called "Integration testing".
-->During Integration will different approaches.
1.Top-Down approach
2.Bottom-Up Approach
3.Hybrid 
4.Big-Bang approach

1.Top-Down approach:-
-----------------------
This approach is recommened if there are any incomplete program at bottom level,in this approach integration testing will be carried out from top to bottom,the incomplete will be replaced with "STUB".

2.Bottom-Up Approach:-
-----------------------
This approach is recommened if there are any incomplete program at Toplevel,in this approach integration testing will be carried out from bottom to top,the incomplete will be replaced with "Drivers".

STUB:-
------
It is a temporary program used to stop user actions

Driver:-
------------
It is a temporary program used to continue user actions

3.Hybrid Approach :-
------------------
It is a combination of Top-down and bottom-up approach.
-->The incomplete program will be replaced botH STUB an Driver.

4.Big-Bang Approach:-
---------------------
Conducting integration after competion of 100% coding which is called as "Big-bang Approach".

Advantages of White-Box testing:-
----------------------------------
1.Finding defects is easy at development side
2.To ensure 100% Code Coverage.



Blackbox Testing:-
-----------------
Once 100% is coding is completed and white box completed to confirm correctness of requirement on the application is called as "Balck Box testing".

--->This testing is conducted by testing team/testers.

--->In Blackbox it is divided into 2 Levels.
1.System Level Testing
2.UAT (User Acceptance testing)


1.System Level Testing:-
--------------------------

Validating both functional and non-functional requirement of the application is called as "System level testing".

Functional testing:-
-------------------
Testing of an application with customer requirements is called as "Functional testing".

Non-Functional Testing:-
-----------------------
Testing of an application with customer expectations is called as "Non-Functional Testing".


Coming to Functional testing it is divided into multiple types of testing

1.Smoke testing
2.Positive Testing
3.Negative testing
4.Re-testing
5.Regression testing
6.End-To -End testing
7.Adhoc Testing

1.Smoke testing:-
-----------------
In this type of testing we need to check basic functionality of an application is called as "Smoke testing".
1.Understanable
2.Operatable
3.Consistency


2.Positive Testing:-
--------------------
In this of testing application check with valid inputs to confirm customer requirements is called as "Positive testing".

3.Negative Testing:-
--------------------

In this of testing application check with Invalid inputs to confirm customer requirements is called as "Positive testing".


4.Re-Testing:-
-------------

Again and again conducting testing on modified functionality is called as "Re-testing".

5.Regression Testing:-
-----------------------

To check the side effects of the functionality along with the nodified functionality is called as "Regression Testing".

6.End-To-end Testing:-
--------------------

In this type of testing,we need to verify end-to-end requirements of an application is called as "end-to-end testing".

7.Adhoc Testing:-
----------------
Due to lack of time (or) within short period of time complete the testing activites is called as "Adhac testing"
1.Buddy Testing
2.Pair Testing
3.Monkey Testing (or)Chimpange Testing (or)Gorizalla Testing

1.Buddy Testing:-
-----------------
Due to lack of time, in this type of testing test enginner will join with developer and conducting testing is called as "Buddy testing".

2.Pair Testing:-
-----------------
During this test two test engineers will working on same module to identify issues is called "Pair testing".

3.Monkey Testing:-
-----------------
Due to lack of time (or)without following any documents conducting testing is called as "Monkey Testing".



Non-Functional Testing:-
---------------------

Once functional testing requirements are satisfied on the applications to confirm customer expectations is called "Non-Functional testing".

1.GUI testing
2.Usability Testing
3.Compatability Testing
4.Security Testing
5.Recovery TEsting
6.Port Testing
7.Performance testing

1.GUI testing:-
---------------
GUI Stands for Graphical user interface.

In this type of testing we need to concentrate on designing part of an application is called "GUI Testing".

1.Colors & Spellings
2.Grammer Mistakes
3.verify LOgo
4.Verify alignment 


2.Usability Testing:-
-----------------------

In this type of testing we should concentrate on customer point of view user friendly (or)not.
1.Easy to use
2.Easy to understand
3.Easy Operate.


3.Compatability Testing:-
--------------------------
In this type of testing we need to concetrate on compatibilty of the application
-->It is divided into 2 types
1.Software compatability
2.hardware Compatability

1.Software compatability:-
-------------------------

In this type of testing application check with various browsers and various operating system.

2.hardware Compatability:-
-----------------------
In this type of testing application check with networks,hardware devices is supporting (or)not is called as"Hardware compatibilty".

4.Security Testing:-
-----------------

In this type of testing we need to concentrate on application is securable (or)not.

5.Recovery TEsting:-
--------------------
In this of testing,application support unexpected situations like power failures,application crahed etc.

6.Port testing:-
---------------
In this type of testing,verify support client envirnoment (or) not is called "Port testing"

7.performance testing:-
-------------------------
performance means speed in processing confirm perfomance

--->as a performance testers this testing will be concentrate.

Principles of Software testing:-
----------------------------------

Theres are 7 Types of principles.
1.Testing shows presence of defects.
2.Exhaustive testing is not possible
3.Defect Clusting
4.Early testing
5.Pesticide paradox
6.Testing is a contect dependent
7.Absence of errors fallacy.

1.Testing shows presence of defects.:-
-------------------------------------
Testing shows only defects present (or)not in current application.but 100 % defect free software is not possible.

2.Exhaustive testing is not possible:-
-------------------------------------
If we test a functionality with all possible inputs called as "Exhaustive testing".but it requires huge resources so exhaustive testing is not possible.

3.Defect Clusting:-
-----------------
Sometimes small modules will produce more no of defects than bigger functionality at that time we should concentrate on such module is called "Defect Clusting".


4.Early testing:-
-------------------

As soon as possible conducting testing is called as "Early testing".

5.Pesticide paradox:-
-------------------
If we are not able to finding the defects with existing test cases then we have add some more defects to identify the defects is called as "Pesticide paradox."

 6.Testing is a contect dependent:-
-------------------------------------

Testing is basically requiremenst dependent so diffent sites will be tested differntly.

7.Absence of errors fallacy.:-
----------------------------
If system is unable to fulfill the user needs/requirements then finding and fixing the defects is no use.



User Acceptance Testing:-
-----------------------
-->It will be initiated after System testing
--->It is a process of conducting application to check with the system requirements are ready to use (or)not

3.Grey Box Testing:-
------------------
It is a combination of White box and Black box Testing is called as "grey box testing".


## STLC:- (Software Testing Life Cycle):-
-----------------------------------------
It explains complete testing activites of current project

1.Test Planning
2.Test Analysis
3.Test Design
4.Test Envirnoment
5.Test Execution
6.Defect Reporting
7.Sign off Testing

1.Test Planning:-
----------------
S.T.L.C Starts with test planning at this phase we prepare two documents test strategy and test planning.

-->Test Strategy is a high level document and this is prepred by test manager (or)project manager.
--->Based on test strategy test plan is prepared by test lead/leam lead.

2.Test Analysis:-
-----------------

Once test plan is prepared,every test enginner concentrating on project requirements by following F.R.S and Use case documents.

-->While analyzing requirements, if you have any doubts prepare R.C.N and send to the domain experts to get clarifications.

3.Test Design:-
--------------
In this phase testing requirements as a two documents such as Test scenarios and test cases.

Test scenario:-
------------
what to test in an application is called as "Test scenario".

test case:-
-----------
How to test in an application is called as "Test cases."


4.Test Envirnoment:-
-------------------

It is a information about current project hardware and software configuration.


5.Test Execution:-
------------------

In this phase to check wheater the application is developed as per customer requirements (or)not to compare expected value and actual value .

6.Defect Reporting:-
--------------------
During execution,if any test cases failed (or)if any expected value is not equal to actual value then we have to post this defect to the developer with the help of some defect tracking tools.

7.Sign off:-
------------
Once 100 % testing is completed (or)most of the major and normal issues are completed we need to sign-off.


Test case design Techniques:-
---------------------------------
1.BVA (Boundary Value Analysis)
2.ECP (Equilance Class Partition)
3.Decision Table testing
4.State Transition
5.Use case Testing
6.Error Guessing

1.BVA (Boundary Value Analysis):-
----------------------------------

It defines size and range of the inputs.
--->While using BVA technique starting value is taken as Lower boundary and ending value is taken as Upper boundary.

Lower Boundary value starts with -1,+1
Upper Boundary value starts with -1 ,+1


EX:-
-----
Min - 5000
Max - 500000


Lower Boundary -1 -->5000-1 =4999 --->fail
Lower Boundary +1 -->5000+1 =5001 -->pass

Upper Boundary -1 = 500000-1 = 499999 -->pass
Upper Boundary +1 =500000+1 =500001 -->fail

2.ECP (Equilance Class Partition):-
-----------------------------------
Its defines type of inputs.
-->According to ECP first we need to analyze valid and invalid inputs then the data is divided into groups.
--->while preparing groups we have to take starting,middle and ending values of inputs.

Ex:-
---
Verify account number

valid 		Invalid
Numerics 	alphamerics
			special characters
			blank spaces



Groups:-
-----------

Valid 	Invalid
------	-------
	Upper Case	lower case	special characters	blank spaces
0	A			 a				#^&*()			…...................
1	M			 m		
2	Z			 z		
3				
4				
5				
6				
7				
8				
9





3.Decision Table testing:-
--------------------------
It is a combination of different inputs and there associated outputs and it is called as "Cause effect table testimg".

4.State Transition Testing:-
----------------------------

Every software application will have various states .the states of application will cahnge from one state to another 
state that is called as "State trasition testing".

5.Use case testing:-
--------------------

It is a clear description of user actions if you develop test cases to check the application wheater it is developed as per use-case document

6.Error Guessing:-
--------------------
Without followng any techniques,based on past experience finding defects is called "Error guessing".

New:-If it a first time defect of the functionality the status will be 'New'.
Re-Open:- If the issue is not fixed by the developer tester can re-open the created defect.
Fixed By :- Developer 
Deteceted Date :- Created date
Detected By:- Tester
Fixed Date :-Date of issue got resolved


Defect Life Cycle/Bug Life Cycle:-
------------------------------------
As soon as possible defect identified by the tester ,those defect will be documented in defect report document.(or)
with the help of bug tracking tool we will post the defect the developer with the Status "New".
-->where developer will analyze,if reported defect is inavlid then developer will update the status "Invalid".
--->If reported bug is valid then developer will update the status "Open".
--->If developer needs more clarification about the defect then developer will update the status as "HOLD".
--->If defect is postpone to next phase then developer will update the status as "deferred".
---->If defect is already reported then the status will be "Duplicate".
--->Once this analyzing is completd developer will start fixing the defect,once defect is fixed then status will be update as "Fixed".
--->Once all defects is fixed developer will modify the build version for re-testing and regression testing.
---->While conducting Re-testing and regression testing ,if defect is fixed then the status will be updated as "Closed".
----->If the defect is not fixed by the developer then the status be marked as "Re-Open".
----->If any new defects is identified in the modified build then the status will be same as "New". same cycle will follows



Re-Testing:-
------------
Again and again conducting the testing on modified functionality is called as "Re-testing".

Regression Testing:-
--------------------
Along with modified functionality and new functionality conducing testing is known as "Regression testing".




Mostly 
i have observed issues like app is getting  crashes when clicking on back button.
when scanningg from camera, app is getting crashes


What are the roles and resonsibilites:-
--------------------------------------


-->Attending sprint meetings to understand current sprint plan
--->Involue in test plan document
--->By Following jira tool will create current plan requirements
--->Preparing test cases by following IEEE standard
--->executing test cases with expected and actual results
---->attending scrum mettings with team members.
--->Involving re and regression testing
--->preparing daily reports to update the status.
---->Reproducing the defects with developers.


1.Understanding the requirements
2.Identifying the test scenarios
3.Preparing the test cases
4.Executing the test cases
5.Defect REporting of failed cases
6.Retesting of fixed defects of previous build
7.Performed various types of testing like smoke,sanity,Compatability,UI testing
8.Participated in regular meetings with team menbers along with managers.
9.Creating automation scripts by using selenium with java.



Quality control: 
----------------
it is a product oriented program and also know as static testing.

Quality Assurance:
---------------
it is a process oriented program and also know as dynamic testing.

Different levels of Manual testing: 
-----------------------------------
There are 4 levels of testing are
Unit testing 
Intergration testing
System level testing
User acceptance testing

When to stop testing:
------------------
1. test cases are completed with certain percentage is passed.
2. bug rate false below a certain level.

Principles of Software testing:-
----------------------------------

Theres are 7 Types of principles.
1.Testing shows presence of defects.
2.Exhaustive testing is not possible
3.Defect Clusting
4.Early testing
5.Pesticide paradox
6.Testing is a contect dependent
7.Absence of errors fallacy.
